	abstract = {This article aims to analyze the impact that the inclusion of students with disabilities has on the achievement of their schoolmates and to analyze the impact that this inclusion has on the achievement of the students with disabilities themselves.The author begins investigating how the inclusion of students with disabilities in regular schools affects achievement of schoolmates. To answer this research question, the author explores the natural variation in time in the number of students with disabilities and use data from National Exam of Upper Secondary Education (Enem). Then, the author investigates how the inclusion affects achievement of the students with disabilities themselves and uses propensity score matching methodologies and, again, data from Enem.The results show that an additional percentage point in the proportion of students with disabilities would reduce schoolmates' writing scores by a 0.0031 standard deviation. In other subjects, the author finds weak or none evidence of a significant peer effect. In addition, using Propensity Score Matching methodologies, the results show that the mean scores are up to 44\% of a standard deviation, which is higher among students with disabilities enrolled in regular schools compared to those who are enrolled in special schools. In summary, the evaluation is that inclusion policies achieve the goal of improving the performance of students with disabilities but such policies have a small and adverse side effect.For this reason, the present study proposes to fill this gap in the literature by analyzing the impact of the inclusion of students with disabilities on both groups. In addition, this paper contributes to the empirical literature of peer effect with an analysis of the peer effect of students with disabilities per competency. Finally, the article is important given the existence of few articles in Brazil on the topic of education and people with disabilities.},

Design Cluster randomized, investigator masked, controlled trial.
Setting 252 primary schools in two prefectures in western China, 2012-13.
Participants 3177 of 19 934 children in fourth and fifth grades (mean age 10.5 years) with visual acuity {\textless}6/12 in either eye without glasses correctable to {\textgreater}6/12 with glasses. 3052 (96.0\%) completed the study.
Interventions Children were randomized by school (84 schools per arm) to one of three interventions at the beginning of the school year: prescription for glasses only (control group), vouchers for free glasses at a local facility, or free glasses provided in class.
Main outcome measures Spectacle wear at endline examination and end of year score on a specially designed mathematics test, adjusted for baseline score and expressed in standard deviations.
Results Among 3177 eligible children, 1036 (32.6\%) were randomized to control, 988 (31.1\%) to vouchers, and 1153 (36.3\%) to free glasses in class. All eligible children would benefit from glasses, but only 15\% wore them at baseline. At closeout glasses wear was 41\% (observed) and 68\% (self reported) in the free glasses group, and 26\% (observed) and 37\% (self reported) in the controls. Effect on test score was 0.11 {SD} (95\% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.21) when the free glasses group was compared with the control group. The adjusted effect of providing free glasses (0.10, 0.002 to 0.19) was greater than parental education (0.03, −0.04 to 0.09) or family wealth (0.01, −0.06 to 0.08). This difference between groups was significant, but was smaller than the prespecified 0.20 {SD} difference that the study was powered to detect.
Conclusions The provision of free glasses to Chinese children with myopia improves children’s performance on mathematics testing to a statistically significant degree, despite imperfect compliance, although the observed difference between groups was smaller than the study was originally designed to detect. Myopia is common and rarely corrected in this setting.

The methodology involved a statistical analysis of nationally held data on all pupils at the end of key stages 1–4, together with a series of site visits to ‘inclusive’ mainstream schools. These were carried out in order to explore school processes that might explain how some schools can manage to be both highly achieving and inclusive. Findings indicate that there is a small, but for all practical purposes, insubstantial relationship between inclusion and academic achievement at the school level although there is also a large degree of variation suggesting strongly there are other factors within a school's make up, rather than its degree of inclusivity, that impact on the average academic achievements of its pupils. This was confirmed from the analysis of the school site visits. The overall conclusion, therefore, is that mainstream schools need not be concerned about the potentially negative impact on the overall academic achievements of their pupils of including pupils with {SEN} in their schools.},

	abstract = {Children with functional difficulties, most of whom live in low- and middle-income countries, have lower foundational literacy and numeracy ({FLN}) skills, primarily due to irregular school attendance, disability-related instructional challenges, and broader structural barriers. Yet, despite these persistent learning gaps, few studies have examined the impact of assistive technologies—beyond wearable devices—on their educational outcomes. In this study, we conduct a field experiment to assess the effect of an educational technology intervention on {FLN} skills of children with functional difficulties in a low-income setting with a high disability incidence. Participants are recruited through a government-led school disability screening program. Those assigned to the intervention group are then provided with a mobile device pre-installed with a computer-assisted learning application designed to support self-regulated study. Eight months post-intervention, we find positive effects on both numeracy and literacy. Aggregate literacy and numeracy skills increase by 0.15 and 0.13 standard deviations ({SD}) respectively, exceeding 50th and 70th percentile of {SD} effects reported in other studies exploring literacy and numeracy outcomes respectively. Females benefit less, particularly on higher-order numeracy and literacy skills. Our treatment effects are primarily driven by usage, rather than by changes in study effort or time allocation, perceptions about schooling, interactions with teachers and peers or in mental wellbeing. We conclude that {EdTech} interventions can be effective in improving {FLN} for children with functional difficulties.},

	title = {Intersectional Inequality in Education},
	abstract = {Intersectional inequality – the notion that disparities run along the lines of combinations of salient social groups such as gender or ethnicity – has become an increasingly prominent concept in the social sciences. Yet, because of the number of possible combinations of groups, embedding intersectionality into the measurement of inequality has proven to be analytically complex. Hence there is little empirical research applying an intersectional framework to measure inequality. We incorporate intersectionality into the measurement of between-group inequalities in educational attainment using {DHS} data from 39 low- and middle-income countries and the United States. Using schooling ratios between lower and higher educated groups as an inequality measure, we show that the intersectional perspective unveils a lot of inequality that remains masked if gender and ethnicity are considered in isolation. Generally, intersectional inequality in education is driven more by ethnic inequality than gender inequality. Further, we develop a novel metric to evaluate the relevance of intersectionality compared to standard approaches of between-group inequality measurement. The new metric, Surplus Intersectionality, reveals substantial heterogeneity between countries in terms of how much intersectionality is present. While gender, ethnic and intersecting inequality all seem to be driven mainly by a country’s average education level, this is not the case for Surplus Intersectionality.},

	abstract = {In many parts of the world, children with disabilities are excluded from education. The disability gap in education is larger in low and middle-income countries, where disability legislation is also much less present. Yet, little is known globally about the effects of disability legislation on the education outcomes of children with disability. Using individual-level data from ten countries, five of which have enacted disability legislation, we employ a difference-in-difference methodology to assess changes in educational outcomes post-legislation. We find that disability legislation significantly improves enrollment, attendance rates and years of schooling, highlighting its role in reducing educational disparities for children with disabilities. We also find heterogeneity in treatment effects across different disability domains— legislation appears to have larger effects on children with hearing disabilities than those with visual disabilities—and age cohorts. Our findings have important policy implications for enhancing educational equity in regions with high disability prevalence and limited legislative coverage, highlighting disability legislation’s potential in such settings.},

	abstract = {This paper examines how students engage with self-directed educational technology in out-of-school settings in low-income settings. While evidence suggests {EdTech} can support learning in low- and middle-income countries, little research explores students’ autonomous usage patterns. We distributed tablets with a multi-subject learning application to 313 students across 63 primary schools in Homabay, a largely rural county in Kenya, and tracked engagement patterns over 18 months through survey and serverbased usage data. We find that while tablet ownership remained high eight months after distribution, app usage was relatively limited, with children using the app for about three months on average. On active days, users engaged for nearly 50 minutes, primarily with Math and English content. Across all grades, students generally selected content below their current grade level, with a substantial share engaging with material at Grade 1 level or below. Nevertheless, usage patterns suggest intentional study choices: students actively switched subjects and grade levels, and most engaged with material that posed some challenge. Boys were more likely to interact with more difficult content, particularly at or above their grade level. We also provide some evidence that a light touch increases engagement with the app, and also document some lessons for implementing {EdTech} interventions in similar settings.},

	abstract = {Although policies to improve forest management have been widely introduced, poor logging practices remain prevalent in tropical forests. We assess whether recent radical changes in forestry laws in Peru will result in significant improvements in logging practices. We adapt North's conceptual framework of institutional change to analyze the impact of governance on loggers' norms and argue that improvements in logging practices will require changes in both laws and norms. The analysis uses survey and field evaluation data on logging practices in Peru, as well as secondary sources. Results show that bringing about radical changes in logging practices is particularly difficult in countries with a history of governance failures in the timber sector. In Peru, governance failures that have promoted norms inconsistent with good management are government's perceived lack of interest in long-term timber management, inconsistent forestry laws, perceived discrimination against the timber sector, and ineffective law enforcement. As a result of decades of these governance failures, loggers developed a short-term perspective on timber extraction and felt entitled to violate government's laws. Poor logging practices continued under the new law because of governance failures. The Peruvian experience shows that changing laws radically is often easier than avoiding governance failures in implementation. While some governance failures were partially rectified, others assumed added significance under the provisions of the new law. Decentralization also exacerbated existing and new governance problems. These failures reinforced existing norms and may, in addition, lead to norms condoning corruption. Modifications need to occur both in norms and in logging laws to reduce the inconsistency between the two. Notable improvements in governance will be required to bring about changes in norms. Changes in the logging system are therefore likely to be far less revolutionary, and to take far longer, than envisioned.},

A large-scale field experiment involving several hundred thousand registered voters used a series of mailings to gauge these effects.

This paper tests for the existence of gender stereotyping and discrimination by public high-school teachers in Israel. It uses a natural experiment based on blind and non-blind scores that students receive on matriculation exams in their senior year. Using data on test results in several subjects in the humanities and sciences, I found, contrary to expectations, that male students face discrimination in each subject. These biases widen the female–male achievement difference because girls outperform boys in all subjects, except English, and at all levels of the curriculum. The bias is evident in all segments of the ability and performance distribution and is robust to various individual controls. Several explanations based on differential behavior between boys and girls are not supported empirically. However, the size of the difference is very sensitive to teachers' characteristics, suggesting that the bias against male students is the result of teachers', and not students', behavior.},

For identification, we rely on the random assignment of teachers and students to classes in primary schools. Our results suggest that assignment to a teacher with a greater bias in favor of girls (boys) has positive effects on girls' (boys') achievements. Such gender biases have also positive impact on girls' (boys') enrollment in advanced level math courses in high school. These results suggest that teachers' biased behavior at early stages of schooling has long run implications for occupational choices and earnings at adulthood, because enrollment in advanced courses in math and science in high school is a prerequisite for post-secondary schooling in engineering, computer science and so on.},

We argue that the problems of each approach may be solved or at least well addressed by teams that combine the two. We also suggest that governmental actors ought to want to learn about why a new policy works as much as they want to know that the policy works. We envision a future evidence-informed public policy practice that (a) involves cross-sector collaborations using the latest theory plus deep contextual knowledge to design new policies, (b) applies the latest insights in research design and statistical inference for causal questions, and (c) is focused on assessing explanations as much as on discovering what works. The evidence-informed public policy movement is a way that new data, new questions, and new collaborators can help political scientists improve our theoretical understanding of politics and also help our policy partners to improve the practice of government itself.},

Bureaucrats’ beliefs about the ruler’s type determine their expectations about whether the ruler would launch an investigation when observing law non-enforcement, which then shapes their incentive to enforce laws. The ruler’s discretion to pursue personal interests has a signaling value as to his or her type. Our game generates a unique separating equilibrium, wherein ruler types differ in whether to exercise discretion to advance personal interests and the bureaucrats enforce the law if and only if not observing the ruler’s discretion. The game also yields two pooling equilibria where different ruler types choose the same strategy.

Special education ({SE}) can potentially improve outcomes for these children, but identifying and providing services to eligible students is problematic, particularly for low-income children and children with “invisible” or “malleable” disabilities like dyslexia, anxiety, or {ADHD}. At the same time, there is no consensus that {SE} enrollment is uniformly positive. There are concerns about stigma, bias in the process, and the impact of expanding {SE} budgets on general education funding. Exploiting variation in expansions to Medicaid eligibility by state, year, and age, we find that increases in Medicaid eligibility generated increased average rates of {SE} enrollment, with effects concentrated among elementary school children, those with malleable disabilities, and those for whom Medicaid expansions were on the intensive margin (gaining additional years of Medicaid eligibility) rather than in the extensive margin (gaining initial eligibility for Medicaid). At the same time, however, children who had more early childhood Medicaid eligibility before they started elementary school were less likely to be enrolled in {SE} than their peers, implying that gaining access to Medicaid in early childhood generated access to screening and treatment that reduced the need for {SE} support in elementary school. Because federal law requires that Medicaid be the primary payer to schools that provide {SE} services, the estimates suggest that by dramatically reducing {SE} enrollment among those with more early childhood Medicaid eligibility and by modestly expanding {SE} enrollment on the intensive margin, Medicaid expansions likely mitigated the impacts of {SE} spending on general education budgets.},

The objective of this study was to test several variants of a potentially scalable, cost-effective intervention to increase cognitive stimulation by parents and improve emergent literacy skills in children. The intervention was a modified dialogic reading training program that used culturally and linguistically appropriate books adapted for a low-literacy population. We used a cluster randomized controlled trial with four intervention arms and one control arm in a sample of caregivers (n?=?357) and their 24- to 83-month-old children (n?=?510) in rural Kenya. The first treatment group received storybooks, while the other treatment arms received storybooks paired with varying quantities of modified dialogic reading training for parents. Main effects of each arm of the trial were examined, and tests of heterogeneity were conducted to examine differential effects among children of illiterate vs. literate caregivers. Parent training paired with the provision of culturally appropriate children’s books increased reading frequency and improved the quality of caregiver-child reading interactions among preschool-aged children. Treatments involving training improved storybook-specific expressive vocabulary. The children of illiterate caregivers benefited at least as much as the children of literate caregivers. For some outcomes, effects were comparable; for other outcomes, there were differentially larger effects for children of illiterate caregivers.},

As disability is not randomly assigned this is an empirical challenge. In this paper we use Danish administrative data and variation in the onset of type 1 diabetes to compare education outcomes of focal children with a disabled sibling to outcomes of focal children without a disabled sibling (matched on date of birth of the focal child, sibling spacing and family size). We find that having a disabled sibling significantly decreases 9th grade exit exam {GPAs}, while having no impact on on-time completion of 9th grade. However, educational trajectories are impacted, as we find significant decreases in high school enrollment and significant increases in vocational school enrollment by age 18. Our results indicate that sibling disability status can generate economically meaningful inequality in educational outcomes.},

Six themes related to the source of teaching knowledge emerged: formal education, formalized bodies of knowledge, observational learning, collaboration with others, enactive experiences, and self-reflection. For beliefs about the stability of teaching knowledge, individuals expressed beliefs about the amount, direction, and quality of knowledge change with regard to various aspects of knowledge (e.g., content knowledge, use and integration of technology, knowledge of development and pedagogy).

	abstract = {Teacher effectiveness is low in many developing countries. How can it be improved? We show that understanding teacher beliefs may be an important but overlooked part of the puzzle. Our review of recent evidence shows that teacher beliefs can impact student outcomes directly; they can also mediate policy implementation. Despite this, we find that teacher beliefs are seldom accounted for or even measured in impact evaluations of teacher-focused programs. Most of these programs ultimately fail to change teacher behavior. Next, using survey data from 20,000 teachers across nine developing countries, we discuss teacher beliefs about their role, their effort, and their students’ learning. We uncover four insights. First, teachers exhibit fixed mindsets on the learning potential of disadvantaged students. For instance, nearly 43 percent of teachers believe that “there is little they can do to help a student learn” if parents are uneducated. Second, in most countries, more teachers believe that students deserve additional attention if they are performing well than if they are lagging behind. This suggests that teachers may be reinforcing rather than compensating for baseline gaps in student levels. Third, there is some normalization of absenteeism—nearly one in four teachers believe it is acceptable to be absent if students are left with work to do. Finally, teacher support for pay-for-performance varies widely across countries.},

The messages included summary information about their students’ use of the platform and encouraged teachers to promote engagement. Receiving the messages led to a 4 percentage point increase in both the proportion of students using the platform and the average number of math exercises completed. Treatment effects decay over time once teachers stop receiving the messages. We find little evidence of impact heterogeneity based on the timing of message receipt, teacher characteristics, or students’ prior platform use and achievement. We supplement these findings with non-experimental evidence showing that student use of the platform increased math learning. Overall, integrating messages to teachers into the scale-up of optional {EdTech} platforms for younger students can be a cost-effective approach to increase use and improve learning outcomes.},

	abstract = {Most discussion of special education has centered on the costs of providing mandated programs for children with disabilities and not on their effectiveness. As in many other policy areas, inferring program effectiveness is difﬁcult because students not in special education do not provide a good comparison group. By following students who move in and out of targeted programs, however, we are able to identify program effectiveness from changes over time in individual performance. We ﬁnd that the average special education program signiﬁcantly boosts mathematics achievement of special-education students, particularly those classiﬁed as learning-disabled or emotionally disturbed, while not detracting from regular-education students. These results are estimated quite precisely from models of students and school-by-grade-by-year ﬁxed effects in achievement gains, and they are robust to a series of speciﬁcation tests.},

The magnitude of the correlations between schooling and skills on the one hand and earnings and skills on the other is consistent with a widespread concern that such skills are underproduced in the schooling system.},

	abstract = {Background. Based on the developing clinical and legal literature, and using the framework adopted 
in draft legislation, capacity to make a valid decision about a clinically required blood test was 
investigated in three groups of people with a ‘mental disability’ (i.e. mental illness (chronic 
schizophrenia), ‘learning disability’ (‘mental retardation’, or intellectual or developmental 
disability), or, dementia) and a fourth, comparison group.Methods. The three ‘mental disability’ groups (N = 20 in the ‘learning disability’ group, N = 21 in 
each of the other two groups) were recruited through the relevant local clinical services; and through 
a phlebotomy clinic for the ‘general population’ comparison group (N = 20). The decision-making 
task was progressively simplified by presenting the relevant information as separate elements and 
modifying the assessment of capacity so that responding became gradually less dependent on 
expressive verbal ability.Results. Compared with the ‘general population’ group, capacity to make the particular decision 
was significantly more impaired in the ‘learning disability’ and ‘dementia’ groups. Importantly, 
however, it was not more impaired among the ‘mental illness’ group. All the groups benefited as 
the decision-making task was simplified, but at different stages. In each of the ‘mental disability’ 
groups, one participant benefited only when responding did not require any expensive verbal ability.Conclusions. Consistent with current views, capacity reflected an interaction between the decision-maker and the demands of the decision-making task. The findings have implications for the way in 
which decisions about health care interventions are sought from people with a ‘mental disability’. 
The methodology may be extended to assess capacity to make other legally-significant decisions.},

Relative age effects are strong for learning disabilities but not for other disabilities. We measure them for boys starting in kindergarten but not for girls until 3rd grade. We also measure them for white and Hispanic students but not for black students or differentially by socioeconomic quartiles. Results are consistent with the interpretation that disability assessments do not screen for the possibility that relatively young students are over-referred for evaluation. Lastly, we present suggestive evidence that math achievement gains due to disability classification may differentially benefit relatively young students.},

	abstract = {Clustered standard errors, with clusters defined by factors such as geography, are widespread in empirical research in economics and many other disciplines. Formally, clustered standard errors adjust for the correlations induced by sampling the outcome variable from a data-generating process with unobserved clusterlevel components. However, the standard econometric framework for clustering leaves important questions unanswered: (i) Why do we adjust standard errors for clustering in some ways but not others, e.g., by state but not by gender, and in observational studies, but not in completely randomized experiments? (ii) Why is conventional clustering an “all-or-nothing” adjustment, while within-cluster correlations can be strong or extremely weak? (iii) In what settings does the choice of whether and how to cluster make a difference? We address these and other questions using a novel framework for clustered inference on average treatment effects. In addition to the common sampling component, the new framework incorporates a design component that accounts for the variability induced on the estimator by the treatment assignment mechanism. We show that, when the number of clusters in the sample is a non-negligible fraction of the number of clusters in the population, conventional cluster standard errors can be severely inflated, and propose new variance estimators that correct for this bias.},

This underrepresentation within the field of economics is present at the undergraduate level, continues into the ranks of the academy, and is barely improving over time. It likely hampers the discipline, constraining the range of issues addressed and limiting our collective ability to understand familiar issues from new and innovative perspectives. In this paper, we first present data on the numbers of women and underrepresented minority groups in the profession. We then offer an overview of current research on the reasons for the underrepresentation, highlighting evidence that may be less familiar to economists. We argue that implicit attitudes and institutional practices may be contributing to the underrepresentation of women and minorities at all stages of the pipeline, calling for new types of research and initiatives to attack the problem. We then review evidence on how diversity affects productivity and propose remedial interventions as well as findings on effectiveness.

The article examines six different definitions of advantage based on household wealth, cognitive skills at age 5, gender, ethnicity (Peru only), maternal education, and nutritional status. The results show no sign that schools are less effective for disadvantaged groups in Vietnam; indeed, if anything one traditionally advantaged group, males, seems to do worse in school than the corresponding disadvantaged group, females. In contrast, in Peru ethnic minority students and students who enter primary school with low cognitive skills appear to learn less in school than ethnic majority students and students with relatively high cognitive skills, respectively, who are enrolled in the same school.},

This paper provides experimental evidence on strategies to support learning when schools close. We conduct a large-scale randomized trial testing two low-technology interventions—{SMS} messages and phone calls—with parents to support their child in Botswana. The combined treatment improves learning by 0.12 standard deviations, which translates to 0.89 standard deviations of learning per {US}\$100, ranking among the most cost-effective interventions to improve learning.

However, the laws have little impact on a number of other outcomes, including fertility, wages, and employment. This paper has two goals. First, using a North Carolina dataset which individually links birth certificate data to school administrative records, it more fully explores the opposite impacts on educational success than previous papers and investigates why students born after the cutoff date have lower educational attainment despite doing better in school. Second, it investigates the impact of school entry laws on teenage fertility and provides some evidence that test scores and years of education have negative impacts, but that these impacts offset each other in the case of school entry laws.},

However, we find no evidence that the age at which children enter school effects job market outcomes, such as wages or the probability of employment. This suggests that the net effect on adult labor market outcomes of the increased educational attainment and poorer academic performance is close to zero.},

We study the case of mandate quotas for workers with disabilities in Brazil, a law establishing that ﬁrms with more than one hundred workers should reserve at least two percent of their vacancies for workers carrying a disability. We ﬁrst employ a diﬀerence-in-discontinuity strategy to show that introducing new inspection procedures to enforce compliance with the quota law increased inspections and the issuing of ﬁnes due to non-compliance. Firms reacted to this increase in enforcement by hiring more workers with disabilities. Interestingly, even ﬁrms not directly impacted by the quota law enforcement reacted to introducing the new inspection procedures, indicating the presence of enforcement spillovers. We then directly test the emergence of spillovers from law enforcement in diﬀerent ﬁrms’ networks. Using a stacked diﬀerences-in-diﬀerences strategy, we show that spillovers arise when a quota law ﬁne happens in the ﬁrm’s neighbor, owner, and human resources workers’ networks. The total number of workers with disabilities hired due to spillover eﬀects is more relevant for the neighbor and the human resources workers’ networks since they are considerably larger than the owner network.},

The automated framework satisfies three important constraints of this development setting: i) The prediction model uses at most ten questions, which limits the costs of data collection; ii) No computation beyond simple arithmetic is needed to calculate the probability that a given household is poor, immediately after data on the ten indicators is collected; and iii) One specification of the model (i.e. one scorecard) is used to predict poverty throughout a country that may be characterized by significant sub-national differences. Using survey data from Zambia, the model's out-of-sample predictions distinguish poor households from non-poor households using information contained in ten questions.},

            The emergence of educational technology (“{EdTech}”) in developing countries has been received as a promising avenue to address some of the most challenging policy questions within educational systems. In this paper, I review and synthesize all existing studies with credible causal identification frameworks of {EdTech} interventions in developing countries. While other studies review the evidence for {EdTech} interventions in developed countries, there is currently no equivalent study for developing contexts, in spite of the rising number of studies being produced. I classify studies into four thematic categories based on the type of {EdTech} intervention analyzed: Access to technology; technology-enabled behavioral interventions; improvements to instruction; and self-led learning. I find that {EdTech} interventions centered around self-led learning and improvements to instruction are the most effective forms of {EdTech} at raising learning outcomes. Similarly, technology-enabled behavioral interventions are less promising for generating large effects but highly cost-effective given their typically low marginal costs. Although expanding access to technology alone is not sufficient to improve learning, it is a necessary first step for some other types of interventions. More broadly, the overall success of interventions rests on the thoughtful customization of the {EdTech} solution to the policy constraints at hand. Finally, {EdTech} interventions across all thematic areas can and should act as complements by leveraging their respective comparative advantages to address deficiencies within educational systems in developing countries.},

            This paper proposes tools for robust inference in difference-in-differences and event-study designs where the parallel trends assumption may be violated. Instead of requiring that parallel trends holds exactly, we impose restrictions on how different the post-treatment violations of parallel trends can be from the pre-treatment differences in trends (“pre-trends”). The causal parameter of interest is partially identified under these restrictions. We introduce two approaches that guarantee uniformly valid inference under the imposed restrictions, and we derive novel results showing that they have desirable power properties in our context. We illustrate how economic knowledge can inform the restrictions on the possible violations of parallel trends in two economic applications. We also highlight how our approach can be used to conduct sensitivity analyses showing what causal conclusions can be drawn under various restrictions on the possible violations of the parallel trends assumption.},

	abstract = {This paper considers sociological understandings of what constitutes disability. Current meanings of disability in both disability studies and medical sociology are examined and compared, using selected articles from leading authors in each discipline as case studies. These disciplines are often represented as offering starkly contrasting approaches to disability, with their differences amounting to a disciplinary 'divide'. It is argued that, on closer inspection, common ground can be found between some writers in disability studies and medical sociology. It is suggested that this situation has arisen because, in disability studies, the social relational understanding of disability developed by Vic Finkelstein and Paul Hunt in the 1970s has been lost over time, overshadowed by the rise to prominence of its offspring: the social model of disability. The paper concludes with some reflections on the need to revive a social relational understanding of disability.},

This is done by estimating education production functions that contain two school fixed effects for each school, one for advantaged children and one for disadvantaged children. The article examines six different definitions of advantage based on household wealth, cognitive skills at age 5, gender, ethnicity (Peru only), maternal education, and nutritional status. The results show no sign that schools are less effective for disadvantaged groups in Vietnam; indeed, if anything one traditionally advantaged group, males, seems to do worse in school than the corresponding disadvantaged group, females. In contrast, in Peru ethnic minority students and students who enter primary school with low cognitive skills appear to learn less in school than ethnic majority students and students with relatively high cognitive skills, respectively, who are enrolled in the same school.},

Increases in household income lead to greater investments in girls' schooling but have no significant impact on schooling of boys. Improvements in father's education raises the schooling of both sons and daughters (favoring the latter) but mother's education has significant impact only on daughters' schooling; these estimates are suggestive of differences in maternal and paternal preferences for schooling daughters relative to sons. Domestic responsibilities, represented for example by the number of very young siblings, impinge strongly on girls' education but not on boys'. Policies such as subsidized childcare that reduce the opportunity cost of girls' time in the home may therefore increase their ability to get an education. {JEL} 015, I21},

	abstract = {Educational applications (apps) offer opportunities for designing learning activities children enjoy and benefit from. We redesigned a typical mobile learning activity to make it more enjoyable and useful for children. Relying on the technology acceptance model, we investigated whether and how implementing this activity in an app can increase children's intention to use. During the 27-day study, children (N = 103, 9–14 years) used the app to memorize one-sentence learning plans each day. Children used three different app-based learning activities throughout the study. In two standard activities, children reread or reassembled the words of the plan. In the redesigned activity, children represented the meaning of the plan with emojis. Children repeatedly reported on their attitude towards each activity. Subsequently, children reported perceived enjoyment and intention to use the app. Results showed children found the emoji activity most enjoyable, and enjoyment of the emoji activity contributed uniquely towards intention to use. Additionally, children's enjoyment of the app mediated their intention to use the app in the future. Overall, the study suggests that children's enjoyment of an app is crucial in predicting their subsequent intention to use, and it provides a concrete example of how emojis can be used to boost enjoyment. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Educational applications provide children with unrestricted access to mobile learning resources. Positive attitudes towards educational applications predict behavioural intention to use these applications, at least in young adults. There is a need for more research examining the relevance of enjoyable learning activities in fostering children's sustained usage of an educational application. What this paper adds Positive attitude towards the use of emojis during learning activities uniquely contributed to children's behavioural intention to use the application. Perceived enjoyment predicted behavioural intention to use the application. Perceived enjoyment mediated the effect of attitude towards using learning activities on the behavioural intention to use the mobile educational application. Implications for practice and/or policy These findings highlight the importance of enjoyment for children's' acceptance of educational applications. Enjoyable learning activities are necessary to ensure sustained usage of educational applications. The paper provides a concrete example of how emojis can be used to boost enjoyment of a typical mobile learning activity.},

Shackleton and his crew of explorers set off aboard the Endurance in the summer of 1914, intent on being the first to cross Antarctica. Well before reaching the continent’s shores, however, the ship became frozen in place in a vast sheet of ice. The men huddled within the captive hull for half a year until the ice crushed it and swallowed it up. Shackleton and his crew were now on their own, without a ship, far from the mainland and even farther from the nearest outpost of civilization. Over the course of the following half year, the men dragged their miserable possessions toward open water, camped on a shrinking ice floe, and braved the stormiest seas on earth in a tiny lifeboat. Finally, in May 1916, Shackleton and a small party reached the safety of St. Georgia. The rest of the crew, stuck on a guano-encrusted outcrop known as Elephant Island, was rescued soon afterward.1},

The review applies consistent inclusion standards to focus on studies that met high methodological standards. A total of 84 qualifying studies based on over 60,000K-12 participants were included in the final analysis. Consistent with previous reviews of similar focus, the findings suggest that educational technology applications generally produced a positive, though small, effect ({ES}=+0.16) in comparison to traditional methods. There were differential impacts of various types of educational technology applications. In particular, the types of supplementary computer-assisted instruction programs that have dominated the classroom use of educational technology in the past few decades were not found to produce educationally meaningful effects in reading for K-12 students ({ES}=+0.11), and the higher the methodological quality of the studies, the lower the effect size. In contrast, innovative technology applications and integrated literacy interventions with the support of extensive professional development showed more promising evidence. Although many more rigorous, especially randomized, studies of newer applications are needed, what unifies the methods found in this review to have great promise is the use of technologies in close connection with teachers’ efforts.},

We find that, perhaps contrary to expectations, many of these children in this context are in mainstream (government and private) schools, although their chances of being in school are lower than their peers. We further find that overall levels of literacy and numeracy are low, even more so for children with disabilities. Our findings corroborate recent research from other countries.

This study provides empirical evidence on the within- and across-country variation in numeracy skills performance among children based on nationally representative data from eight African countries ({DR} Congo, The Gambia, Ghana, Lesotho, Sierra Leone, Togo, Tunisia, and Zimbabwe). We assess whether and to what extent children with disabilities lag in numeracy skills and how much it depends on their type of disabilities. More specifically, we explore whether disabled children benefit equally from better school system quality. The assessment is analysed as a natural experiment using the performance of non-disabled children as a benchmark and considering the different types of disabilities as random treatments. We first evaluate the variation in average numeracy skills in the eight African countries. They can roughly be divided into low- and high-numeracy countries. We apply Instrumental Variable ({IV}) methods to control the endogeneity of completed school years when assessing subjects’ school performance and heterogeneous disability effects. Children with vision and hearing disabilities are not especially challenged in numeracy skills performance. The low numeracy skills among physically and intellectually disabled children are mainly attributable to their limited school attendance. Children with multiple disabilities are constrained both by low school attendance and by poor numeracy skills return to schooling. The average differences in school performance across the high- versus low-numeracy skill country groups are larger than the within-group average differences for disabled versus non-disabled kids. This indicates that school enrolment and quality are crucial for children’s learning of numeracy skills, and that disabled children benefit equally from better school quality across these African countries.},

	abstract = {Many low- and middle-income countries lag far behind high-income countries in educational access and student learning. Limited resources mean that policymakers must make tough choices about which investments to make to improve education. Although hundreds of education interventions have been rigorously evaluated, making comparisons between the results is challenging. Some studies report changes in years of schooling; others report changes in learning. Standard deviations, the metric typically used to report learning gains, measure gains relative to a local distribution of test scores. This metric makes it hard to judge if the gain is worth the cost in absolute terms. This paper proposes using learning-adjusted years of schooling ({LAYS})—which combines access and quality and compares gains to an absolute, cross-country standard—as a new metric for reporting gains from education interventions. The paper applies {LAYS} to compare the effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness, where cost is available) of interventions from 150 impact evaluations across 46 countries. The results show that some of the most cost-effective programs deliver the equivalent of three additional years of high-quality schooling (that is, schooling at quality comparable to the highest-performing education systems) for just \$100 per child—compared with zero years for other classes of interventions.},

But as recent research shows, students in different countries who have completed the same number of years of school often have vastly different learning outcomes. We therefore propose a new summary measure, the Learning-Adjusted Years of Schooling ({LAYS}). This measure combines quantity and quality of schooling into a single easy-to-understand metric of progress, revealing con­ siderably larger cross-country education gaps than the standard metric. We show that the comparisons produced by this measure are robust to different ways of adjusting for learning and that {LAYS} is consistent with other evidence, including other approaches to quality adjustment. Like other learning measures, {LAYS} reflects learning, and barriers to learning, both inside and outside of school; also, cross-country comparability of {LAYS} rests on assumptions related to learning trajectories and the validity, reliability, and comparability of test data. Acknowledging these limitations, we argue that {LAYS} nonetheless improves on the standard metric in key ways.},

The {LAYS} combine measures of school quantity and school quality into a single measure. Using a dynamic panel data framework, we ﬁnd that the {LAYS} have a positive association with growth and appear to be a more robust predictor of economic outcome than the traditional measures of education such as the mean school years. We also investigate the interrelationship between institutional quality and the {LAYS}. Our evidence suggests that human capital and ‘good’ institutions serve as substitutes in the growth process, meaning that the positive association of the {LAYS} with growth is smaller in countries where institutions are already strong than in countries with poorly functioning institutions. Our results have important policy implications, since investments in human capital and institutional quality are both costly measures, especially for developing countries.},

In this paper, we examine whether legislation to advance inclusive education can increase the likelihood of children with disabilities attending school in a low-income country. Using a difference-in-difference methodology, we find that children with visual, hearing, and physical disabilities, who began school at a time when inclusive education was guaranteed in Uganda, had a significantly higher likelihood of going to school than children with disabilities in comparator countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, as well as children with disabilities in Uganda who became of school age prior to the passage of legislation. However, this was no longer true when considering only the sample of children reported to have no ability to see, hear, or engage in physical activities.

            The emergence of educational technology (“{EdTech}”) in developing countries has been received as a promising avenue to address some of the most challenging policy questions within educational systems. In this paper, I review and synthesize all existing studies with credible causal identification frameworks of {EdTech} interventions in developing countries. While other studies review the evidence for {EdTech} interventions in developed countries, there is currently no equivalent study for developing contexts, in spite of the rising number of studies being produced. I classify studies into four thematic categories based on the type of {EdTech} intervention analyzed: Access to technology; technology-enabled behavioral interventions; improvements to instruction; and self-led learning. I find that {EdTech} interventions centered around self-led learning and improvements to instruction are the most effective forms of {EdTech} at raising learning outcomes. Similarly, technology-enabled behavioral interventions are less promising for generating large effects but highly cost-effective given their typically low marginal costs. Although expanding access to technology alone is not sufficient to improve learning, it is a necessary first step for some other types of interventions. More broadly, the overall success of interventions rests on the thoughtful customization of the {EdTech} solution to the policy constraints at hand. Finally, {EdTech} interventions across all thematic areas can and should act as complements by leveraging their respective comparative advantages to address deficiencies within educational systems in developing countries.},

Progress rate was then correlated with teacher ratings of extent of disability and independent ratings of pupil engagement with the apps. Results showed {SEND} pupils could interact with the apps and all pupils passed at least one topic. Average progress rate for {SEND} pupils was twice as long as mainstream peers. Stepwise regression revealed extent of disability significantly predicted progress rate. Further exploratory correlations revealed pupils with moderate to severe difficulties with hearing and/or language made slower progress through the apps than those with greater functionality in these two domains because the use of verbal instructions within the apps limited their capacity to learn. This original quantitative analysis demonstrates that interactive apps can raise learning standards in pupils with {SEND} but may have limited utility for pupils with severe difficulties.

rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of technology-based approaches to education in developed countries and outlines areas for future inquiry. In particular, we examine randomized

Using data from Chile, Croatia, Sweden, and the United States, we study within-family spillovers in college and major choice across a variety of national contexts. Exploiting college-specific admissions thresholds that directly affect older but not younger siblings’ college options, we show that in all four countries a meaningful portion of younger siblings follow their older sibling to the same college or college-major combination. Older siblings are followed regardless of whether their target and counterfactual options have large, small, or even negative differences in quality. Spillover effects disappear, however, if the older sibling drops out of college, suggesting that older siblings’ college experiences matter. That siblings influence important human capital investment decisions across such varied contexts suggests that our findings are not an artifact of particular institutional detail but a more generalizable description of human behavior. Causal links between the postsecondary paths of close peers may partly explain persistent college enrollment inequalities between social groups, and this suggests that interventions to improve college access may have multiplier effects.},

	abstract = {Interactive apps delivered on touch-screen tablets can be effective at supporting the acquisition of basic skills in mainstream primary school children. This technology may also be beneficial for children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities ({SEND}) as it can promote high levels of engagement with the learning task and an inclusive learning environment. However, few studies have measured extent of learning for {SEND} pupils when using interactive apps, so it has yet to be determined if this technology is effective at raising attainment for these pupils. We report the first observational study of a group of 33 pupils with {SEND} from two primary schools in Malawi that are implementing a new digital technology intervention which uses touch-screen tablets to deliver interactive apps designed to teach basic mathematical skills. The apps contain topics that align to the national curriculum. To assess learning gains, rate of progress (minutes per topic) for each pupil was determined by calculating the average time taken to complete a topic. Progress rate was then correlated with teacher ratings of extent of disability and independent ratings of pupil engagement with the apps. Results showed {SEND} pupils could interact with the apps and all pupils passed at least one topic. Average progress rate for {SEND} pupils was twice as long as mainstream peers. Stepwise regression revealed extent of disability significantly predicted progress rate. Further exploratory correlations revealed pupils with moderate to severe difficulties with hearing and/or language made slower progress through the apps than those with greater functionality in these two domains because the use of verbal instructions within the apps limited their capacity to learn.

	abstract = {Background In the new Sustainable Development Goal 4, quality of education defined as equity and inclusion alongside traditional learning outcomes, has replaced the narrow goal of access to primary education stipulated in the Millennium Development Goal 2. Since 2000, considerable progress has been made towards improving access to school for children in India, yet questions remain regarding not just children with disabilities’ access and acquisition of basic learning skills, but also completion of learning cycles. Methods and findings Between November, 2, 2011 and June 20th 2012, we interviewed 1294 households about activity limitations and functioning difficulties associated with a health problem among all family members using a validated screening instruments, as well as questions about access, retention and barriers to education. We found that vulnerable children, particularly children with disabilities are less likely to start school and more likely to drop out of school earlier and before completing their high school education than non-disabled children, showing that the learning process is not inclusive in practice. The gap is wider for girls, economically deprived children, or children from households where the head is uneducated. Conclusions Firstly, in order to fill the existing knowledge gap on education of children with disabilities in line with {SDG}4, not only is there a necessity for relevant data with regards to learning outcomes, but also an urgent requirement for more innovative information pertaining to relational aspects of learning that reflect inclusion. Secondly, a stronger understanding of the implications of early assessment would further promote equity in education. Finally, research should tackle learning as a complex and dynamic phenomenon. Education needs to fulfil its instrumental value, but must also re-claim its intrinsic value that often gets watered down in the journey from policies to implementation.},

The ﬁrst 1000 days of life are often cited as a ‘critical period’ for child development, but this notion has rarely been directly tested. In a setting in which children are potentially subject to shocks in every year of their childhood, I estimate the impact of early life weather shocks on adult cognitive and socioemotional outcomes for individuals born in rural Indonesia between 1988 and 2000. There is a strong critical period for these shocks at age 2 for cognitive development, but no evidence for a similar critical period for socioemotional development. The effects appear to be driven by changes in agricultural income and nutritional investment. The impacts are initially latent, only appearing after age 15. I show suggestive evidence for dynamic complementarity in early life investments.},

Furthermore, an increase in special school placement has been reported, prompting this investigation of the role of special schools in the current climate of inclusion. Literature from Britain, Europe and New Zealand, including research that listens to ‘the voice of the child’, which compares experiences of children with special educational needs in special and mainstream schools, is reviewed.

The potency of the stigma of mental illness is one reason why some ethnic minority group members who would benefit from mental health services elect not to seek or adequately participate in treatment.

	abstract = {Education is important for all children, but even more so for children with disabilities, whose social and economic opportunities may be limited. In this article, Laudan Aron and Pamela Loprest assess how well the nation s education system is serving students with disabilities. Aron and Loprest trace the evolution of the special education system in the United States from its origins in the civil rights movement of the mid-twentieth century. They note the dual character of federal legislation, which both guarantees eligible children with disabilities the right to a "free, appropriate public education in the least restrictive setting" and establishes a federal funding program to help meet this goal. They then review the types of services and accommodations these children receive from infancy through young adulthood. The special education system has given children with disabilities much greater access to public education, established an infrastructure for educating them, helped with the earlier identification of disabilities, and promoted greater inclusion of these children alongside their nondisabled peers. Despite these advances, many problems remain, including the over-and underidentification of certain subgroups of students, delays in identifying and serving students, and bureaucratic, regulatory, and financial barriers that complicate the program for everyone involved. More important, the authors show that special education students still lag behind their nondisabled peers in educational achievements, are often held to lower expectations, are less likely to take the full academic curriculum in high school, and are more likely to drop out of school. Only limited evidence is available on the effectiveness of specific special education services or on how to improve student achievement for this important subgroup of students. Improving the system will require better ways of understanding and measuring both ends of the special education continuum, namely, what services special education children need and receive, and what academic outcomes these students achieve. Without stronger evidence linking these two aspects of the system, Aron and Loprest argue, researchers will be unable to gauge the efficacy of the services now being delivered or to formulate effective reforms to the system as a whole.},

In this review, we examine 145 recent empirical studies (from 2014 onward) on how to increase access to and improve the quality of education across the continent, specifically examining how these studies update previous research findings. We find that 64\% of the studies evaluate government-implemented programs, 36\% include detailed cost analysis and 35\% evaluate multiple treatment arms. We identify several areas where new studies provide rigorous evidence on topics that do not figure prominently in earlier evidence syntheses. New evidence shows promising impacts of structured pedagogy interventions (which typically provide a variety of inputs, such as lesson plans and training for teachers together with new materials for students) and of mother tongue instruction interventions, as well as from a range of teacher programs, including both remunerative (pay-for-performance of various designs) and non-remunerative (coaching and certain types of training) programs. School feeding delivers gains in both access and learning. New studies also show long-term positive impacts of eliminating school fees for primary school and positive impacts of eliminating fees in secondary school. Education technology interventions have decidedly mixed impacts, as do school grant programs and programs providing individual learning inputs (e.g., uniforms or textbooks).},

	abstract = {More than 20 percent of all school-aged children in the United States have vision problems, and low-income and minority children are disproportionately likely to have unmet vision care needs. Vision screening is common in U.S. schools, but it remains an open question whether screening alone is sufficient to improve student outcomes. We implemented a multi-armed randomized controlled trial ({RCT}) to evaluate the impact of vision screening, and of vision screening accompanied by eye exams and eyeglasses, provided by a non-profit organization to Title I elementary schools in three large central Florida school districts. We find that providing additional/enhanced screening alone is generally insufficient to improve student achievement in math and reading. In contrast, providing screening along with free eye exams and free eyeglasses to students with vision problems improved student achievement as measured by standardized test scores. We find, averaging over all students (including those without vision problems), that this more comprehensive intervention increased the probability of passing the Florida Comprehensive Achievement Tests ({FCATs}) in reading and math by approximately 2.0 percentage points. We also present evidence that indicates that this impact fades out over time, indicating that follow-up actions after the intervention may be necessary to sustain these estimated achievement gains.},

The command allows for specification of the number of clusters available, or the cluster size, or the average cluster size along with an estimate of the variation of cluster sizes. When the number of clusters available is insufficient to detect the required difference at the prespecified power, clustersampsi will return the minimum number of clusters required under the prespecified design along with the minimum detectable difference and maximum achievable power (both for the pre-specified number of clusters). Cluster heterogeneity can be parameterized by using either the intracluster correlation or the coefficient of variation. The command is illustrated via examples.},

At the time of the study, Bridge operated over 400 private schools serving more than 100,000 pupils. It hired teachers with less formal education and experience than public school teachers, paid them less, and had more working hours per week. Enrolling at Bridge for two years increased test scores by 0.89 additional equivalent years of schooling ({EYS}) for primary school pupils and by 1.48 {EYS} for pre-primary pupils. These effects exceed the 90th percentile of studies examined by Evans and Yuan (2020) and the 99th percentile of treatment effects of large sample studies reviewed in the same study.

	abstract = {Background In the new Sustainable Development Goal 4, quality of education defined as equity and inclusion alongside traditional learning outcomes, has replaced the narrow goal of access to primary education stipulated in the Millennium Development Goal 2. Since 2000, considerable progress has been made towards improving access to school for children in India, yet questions remain regarding not just children with disabilities’ access and acquisition of basic learning skills, but also completion of learning cycles. Methods and findings Between November, 2, 2011 and June 20th 2012, we interviewed 1294 households about activity limitations and functioning difficulties associated with a health problem among all family members using a validated screening instruments, as well as questions about access, retention and barriers to education. We found that vulnerable children, particularly children with disabilities are less likely to start school and more likely to drop out of school earlier and before completing their high school education than non-disabled children, showing that the learning process is not inclusive in practice. The gap is wider for girls, economically deprived children, or children from households where the head is uneducated. Conclusions Firstly, in order to fill the existing knowledge gap on education of children with disabilities in line with {SDG}4, not only is there a necessity for relevant data with regards to learning outcomes, but also an urgent requirement for more innovative information pertaining to relational aspects of learning that reflect inclusion. Secondly, a stronger understanding of the implications of early assessment would further promote equity in education. Finally, research should tackle learning as a complex and dynamic phenomenon. Education needs to fulfil its instrumental value, but must also re-claim its intrinsic value that often gets watered down in the journey from policies to implementation.},

We employ a difference-in-differences strategy that exploits these variations to identify the effects of the {FPE} policy. Using data from the 2000 Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey and the 2002 Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire survey, we find that the {FPE} policy increased enrolment of primary school-age children by 19.1 percentage points between 1999 and 2002. We also find that the policy had a negative effect on relative grade attainment: post-{FPE}, children had 0.15 fewer grades per year of age compared to pre-{FPE}.

	abstract = {Little research has been published investigating the experiences of physical and emotional support for children with disabilities in the Australian school context. The aim of this phenomenological study was to explore how children with disabilities experienced support when they were bullied at school. Qualitative interviews with 10 children, aged 8–10 years, were analysed. The children had a range of disabilities, including physical, visual and hearing impairments. The four themes that emerged were: (1) bullying experiences; (2) coping with bullying; (3) importance of friends; (4) adult responses to bullying. The implications of the contributions to this study for bullying research specific to the lives of children with disabilities are discussed, such as providing educational and health professionals with a knowledge of the support that children with disabilities draw on when they experience bullying.},

	abstract = {While a large literature has investigated the role of parental human capital on children’s well-being, relatively little is known regarding the effects of human capital investment in children on long run outcomes of parents. In this study we explore the human capital variations created by the 1974 Tanzania education reform to estimate the effect of children’s primary schooling attainment on parental survival. Using 5,026,315 census records from 1988, 2002, and 2012, we show that the 1974 reform resulted in an additional 1.1 years (31\%) of educational attainment among exposed cohorts. Using the reform as instrument for child education we find that each additional year of primary schooling in children resulted in a 3.7 percentage point reduction (p {\textless} .001) in the probability of maternal death, and a 0.8 percentage point reduction (p = .011) in the probability of paternal death by the time exposed child cohorts reach age 50. The results suggest that—at least in a setting where social security coverage is largely absent—a substantial fraction of human capital gains generated by reforms are shared with the parental generation.},

Since that time both countries have clarified and amended their respective laws and policies, and signed the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities ({UN} 2006) which urges States to reallocate resourcing to inclusive education, and to reduce segregation. In this article, I examine the policy reforms in each country and analyse aggregated and disaggregated student placement data within each context to consider the impact of these reforms for different groups of students. Results show that the different reform journeys in each context produced different outcomes for students in each country, with segregation increasing in Australia and decreasing in the {USA}. The results also suggest that the impact of these policies has not been proportionate across categories as students on the Autism Spectrum are more likely to experience educational segregation or exclusion in both countries.},

              This paper aims to identify and draw together key themes in the literature relating to the impact of disability on labour market outcomes. In doing so it provides an overview of issues in estimation in empirical work relating to disability.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              This paper reviews the existing international evidence relating to the impact of disability on labour market outcomes.
            
            
              Findings
              Regardless of country, data source or time period disability serves to reduce labour market prospects. Understanding the reasons for this requires consideration of issues such as separating discrimination from unobserved differences in productivity and preferences, the influence of heterogeneity within the disabled group and the dynamic effects of disability.
            
            
              Practical implications
              The paper also reviews recent evidence concerning the labour market impact of significant changes in legislation affecting the disabled, particularly the introduction of the Americans with Disabilities Act in the {USA}. This evidence is particularly useful to policymakers.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The paper provides a comprehensive review of the empirical evidence relating to the labour market impact of disability and the influence of recent changes in legislation.},

	shorttitle = {The development and testing of a module on child functioning for identifying children with disabilities on surveys. {III}},
	abstract = {Background
A module on child functioning developed by {UNICEF} and the Washington Group on Disability Statistics ({WG}) for use in censuses and surveys reflects current thinking around disability measurement and is intended to produce internationally comparable data. The Child Functioning Module ({CFM}) was developed in response to limitations of the Ten Question Screening Instrument ({TQSI}) for use in surveys and builds on the {WG} Short Set ({WG}-{SS}) of questions that was designed to capture disability in censuses, particularly among the adult population.

Objective
This paper documents the testing of the module and summarizes its results, including a description of prevalence levels across countries using different cut-offs, and comparisons with prevalence levels obtained using the {TQSI} and the {WG}-{SS}.

Methods
Field tests were conducted in Samoa as part of the 2014 Demographic and Health Survey and in Mexico as part of the 2015 National Survey of Boys, Girls and Women. The module was also implemented in Serbia as part of a dedicated survey conducted in the province of Vojvodina, in February 2016.

Results
Using the recommended cut-offcut-off, the percentage of children reported as having functional difficulty ranges from 1.1\% in Serbia to 2\% in Mexico among children aged 2–4 years, and from 3.2\% in Samoa to 11.2\% in Mexico among children aged 5–17 years. Across all three countries, the prevalence of functional difficulty was highest in the socio-emotional domains., A comparison of the prevalence levels obtained using the {WG}-{SS} and the {CFM} shows that, except for the question on cognition/learning, the {WG}-{SS} and the {CFM} are relatively close for children aged 5–17 years for the domains that are included in both question sets, but the {WG}-{SS} excludes many children identified by the {CFM} in other domains. The comparison between the {TQSI} and the {CFM} shows that, while the prevalence estimates are similar for seeing and hearing, significant differences affect other domains, particularly cognition/learning and communication.

Conclusions
The {CFM} addresses a full range of functional domains that are important for child development. The module represents an improvement on the {TQSI} in that it allows for scaled responses to determine the degree of difficulty, and so can separate out many potential false positives. The module is also preferred over the {WG}-{SS} for collecting data on children, first, because most of the questions in the {WG}-{SS} are not suitable for children under the age of 5 years, and second, because the {WG}-{SS} leaves out important functional domains for children aged 5–17 years, namely those related to developmental disabilities and behavioural issues.},

It was conducted between January and June 2019, involving a target population which comprised 3 government universal primary schools, with a total of 94 teachers and 2,386 learners. Study samples were selected, involving special needs education teachers (N = 73) and {LwDs} and {OSNs} (N = 30). Purposive sampling method was used to choose the required samples. A descriptive study design, involving qualitative approach was used. Open ended questionnaires and interview guides were used for collecting data on the critical role that teachers play in supporting {LwDs} and {OSNs} who experience barriers to learning under inclusive setting. One of the findings reveals that class size poses a serious challenge to teachers who are not well trained when they have {LwDs} and {OSNs} in large classes. Another finding indicates that teachers face challenges with the way the curriculum is designed—posing challenge to them on how to best handle it. It is also found that teachers face challenge to manage the average class number (teacher-learner ratio). It is also found that class room environment, resources and implementation of policies on education for {LwDs} and {OSNs} have both direct and indirect influence on the teachers’ impact in class. Basing on the findings, recommendations were made that: relevant authorities should increase support for teacher training and retraining for {LwDs} and {OSNs}. That curriculum modification should be done regularly. Classroom environments need regular improvement to be more disability friendly. Lastly, implementation of policies on disabilities and other special needs should be carried out on regular basis.},

This holds true for several objective poverty measures, which are both absolute and relative in nature, and a subjective poverty measure. An additional year of education thus reduces not only the likelihood of being classified as living in poverty but also the likelihood of considering oneself to live in poverty. Increases in labor force participation and full-time employment as well as better health are potential mechanisms behind these results.

After describing the basic idea of the calculation procedure in a brief tutorial, I tackle the practice of sample size calculations in the field of experimental economics by considering the publications of 5 economic journals in the period 2000–2018. These are two top-ranked economic journals (Quarterly Journals of Economics and American Economic Review), the leading field journals in the area of experimental economics (Experimental Economics) and behavioral sciences (Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization), and a leading field journal in environmental economics (Environmental and Resource Economics). In contrast to clinical drug trials, sample size calculations have rarely been carried out by experimental economists. But the number of power calculations has slightly increased in recent years, especially in the top-ranked journals of economics. However, this can be partly explained by the fact that field experiments (in which scholars pay more attention to power analyses than in lab experiments these days) play an important role in these journals.},

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate how anti-discrimination legislation in the form of the {UK} Disability Discrimination Act ({DDA}) affected socioeconomic disparities in the employment rates of people with a limiting long-term illness ({LLTI}) or disability.
Design: National cross-sectional data on employment rates for people with and without an {LLTI} or disability were obtained from the General Household Survey ({GHS}) for a 14-year period (1990–2003; 12 surveys). Representative population samples were analysed. The sample size for the {GHS} over the study period ranged from 19 193 to 24 657 and the average response rate ranged from 72\% to 82\%.
Main outcome measure: Age-standardised employment rates for individuals with and without an {LLTI} or disability, analysed by sex and socioeconomic status.
Results: Analysis of covariance identified that the {DDA} had had a negative effect on employment rates for individuals with an {LLTI} or disability during the study period. This negative effect was found to be differential according to social class ranging from no effect in social classes I and {II} (−2.86\%, 95\% {CI} −8.7\% to 2.99\%), increasing with social class group, to a highly significant effect in social classes {IV} and V (−10.7\%, 95\% {CI} −6.16\% to −15.24\%). No differential effect was identified by sex.
Conclusions: Anti-discriminatory legislation is not an effective way of overcoming the employment consequences of ill health and disability, nor is it a useful public policy tool in terms of reducing inequalities.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVES}: This article provides an introduction to the October 2011 special issue of the Journal of School Health on “Healthier Students Are Better Learners.” {METHODS}: Literature was reviewed and synthesized to identify health problems affecting school-aged youth that are highly prevalent, disproportionately affect urban minority youth, directly and indirectly causally affect academic achievement, and can be feasibly and effectively addressed through school health programs and services. {RESULTS}: Based on these criteria, 7 educationally relevant health disparities were selected as strategic priorities to help close the achievement gap: (1) vision, (2) asthma, (3) teen pregnancy, (4) aggression and violence, (5) physical activity, (6) breakfast, and (7) inattention and hyperactivity. Research clearly shows that these health problems influence students' motivation and ability to learn. Disparities among urban minority youth are outlined, along with the causal pathways through which each adversely affects academic achievement, including sensory perceptions, cognition, school connectedness, absenteeism, and dropping out. Evidence-based approaches that schools can implement to address these problems are presented. These health problems and the causal pathways they influence have interactive and a synergistic effect, which is why they must be addressed collectively using a coordinated approach. {CONCLUSIONS}: No matter how well teachers are prepared to teach, no matter what accountability measures are put in place, no matter what governing structures are established for schools, educational progress will be profoundly limited if students are not motivated and able to learn. Particular health problems play a major role in limiting the motivation and ability to learn of urban minority youth. This is why reducing these disparities through a coordinated approach warrants validation as a cohesive school improvement initiative to close the achievement gap. Local, state, and national policies for implementing this recommendation are suggested.},

	abstract = {Background: Interventions to promote mental well-being can bring benefits to the individual and to society. The Internet can facilitate the large-scale and low-cost delivery of individually targeted health promoting interventions. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a self-directed Internet-delivered cognitive-behavioral skills training tool in improving mental well-being in a population sample. Methods: This was a randomized trial with a waiting-list control. Using advertisements on a national health portal and through its mailing list, we recruited 3070 participants aged 18 or over, resident in England, and willing to give their email address and access a fully automated Web-based intervention. The intervention ({MoodGYM}) consisted of 5 interactive modules that teach cognitive-behavioral principles. Participants in the intervention arm received weekly email reminders to access the intervention. The control group received access to the intervention after the trial was completed and received no specific intervention or email reminders. Outcomes were assessed by using self-completion questionnaires. The primary outcome was mental well-being measured with the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale ({WEMWBS}). Secondary outcomes were Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale ({CES}-D) depression scores, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale ({GAD}-7) anxiety scores, {EuroQol} Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire ({EQ}-5D) quality of life scores, physical activity, and health service use. All outcomes were measured at baseline, and at 6- and 12-week follow-ups. Results: A total of 1529 (49.80\%) participants completed final follow-up at 12 weeks. Retention was 73.11\% (1123/1536) in the control arm and 26.47\% (406/1534) in the intervention arm. No relationship between baseline measures and withdrawal could be established. The analysis of {WEMWBS} mental well-being scores using a linear mixed model for repeated measures showed no difference between intervention and control group at baseline (difference \&\#8211;0.124 points, 95\% {CI} \&\#8211;0.814 to 0.566), and significant improvements for the intervention group at 6 weeks (2.542 points, 95\% {CI} 1.693-3.390) and at 12 weeks (2.876 points, 95\% {CI} 1.933-3.819). The model showed a highly significant (P\&\#60;.001) intervention by time interaction effect. There were also significant improvements in self-rated scores of depression and anxiety. Given the high level of attrition, a sensitivity analysis with imputed missing values was undertaken that also showed a significant positive effect of the intervention. Conclusions: Participants allocated to the intervention arm had an average increase of approximately 3 points on the {WEMWBS} scale compared to no increase for participants in the control group. Three points on this scale is approximately one-third of a standard deviation. In a low-cost automated intervention designed to shift the population distribution of mental well-being, a small difference per individual could yield a major benefit in population terms. In common with other Web-based interventions, there were high rates of attrition. Further work is needed to improve acceptability, to evaluate against placebo effect, and to disaggregate the effect on mental well-being from the effect on depression and anxiety.

Moreover, students in higher education ({HE}) are reported to have increased symptoms of mental ill health compared with age‐matched controls. Some students in further education ({FE}) are likely to experience similar difficulties, especially as an increasing number may come from backgrounds that may make them more vulnerable to mental health problems. National policies and guidance highlight the importance of promoting the mental health of young people in general and of students in particular. This exploratory study aimed to identify whether, and in what ways, {FE} colleges were contributing to younger students' (aged 16–19 years) mental health. Interviews with key informants, a survey of {FE} colleges in England and five case studies of individual {FE} colleges providing specialised mental‐health support services to students revealed some evidence of promising and good practice, but this did not appear to be widespread. Given the current range of college settings, no single approach to improving mental health among students is likely to be the answer. Rather, respondents highlighted a number of factors that influence the provision of support services for students: awareness among professionals of the links between students' mental health and their achievement at college; having in place national and college policies and guidance that address mental health; building an inclusive college ethos; building leadership at senior and middle manager levels; having accessible in‐college and/or external support services; and the provision of professional development opportunities for staff.},

We sought to assess whether “Upgrade glasses” could avoid reduced glasses sales when offering free glasses to children in China. Methods In this cluster-randomized, controlled trial, children with uncorrected visual acuity ({VA}){\textless} = 6/12 in either eye correctable to {\textgreater}6/12 in both eyes at 138 randomly-selected primary schools in 9 counties in Guangdong and Yunnan provinces, China, were randomized by school to one of four groups: glasses prescription only (Control); Free Glasses; Free Glasses + offer of \$15 Upgrade Glasses; Free Glasses + offer of \$30 Upgrade Glasses. Spectacle purchase (main outcome) was assessed 6 months after randomization. Results Among 10,234 children screened, 882 (8.62\%, mean age 10.6 years, 45.5\% boys) were eligible and randomized: 257 (29.1\%) at 37 schools to Control; 253 (28.7\%) at 32 schools to Free Glasses; 187 (21.2\%) at 31 schools to Free Glasses + \$15 Upgrade; and 185 (21.0\%) at 27 schools to Free Glasses +\$30 Upgrade. Baseline ownership among these children needing glasses was 11.8\% (104/882), and 867 (98.3\%) children completed follow-up. Glasses purchase was significantly less likely when free glasses were given: Control: 59/250 = 23.6\%; Free glasses: 32/252 = 12.7\%, P = 0.010. Offering Upgrade Glasses eliminated this difference: Free + \$15 Upgrade: 39/183 = 21.3\%, multiple regression relative risk ({RR}) 0.90 (0.56–1.43), P = 0.65; Free + \$30 Upgrade: 38/182 = 20.9\%, {RR} 0.91 (0.59, 1.42), P = 0.69. Conclusions Upgrade glasses can prevent reductions in glasses purchase when free spectacles are provided, providing important program income.

	abstract = {Interactive apps delivered on touch-screen tablets can be effective at supporting the acquisition of basic skills in mainstream primary school children. This technology may also be beneficial for children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities ({SEND}) as it can promote high levels of engagement with the learning task and an inclusive learning environment. However, few studies have measured extent of learning for {SEND} pupils when using interactive apps, so it has yet to be determined if this technology is effective at raising attainment for these pupils. We report the first observational study of a group of 33 pupils with {SEND} from two primary schools in Malawi that are implementing a new digital technology intervention which uses touch-screen tablets to deliver interactive apps designed to teach basic mathematical skills. The apps contain topics that align to the national curriculum. To assess learning gains, rate of progress (minutes per topic) for each pupil was determined by calculating the average time taken to complete a topic. Progress rate was then correlated with teacher ratings of extent of disability and independent ratings of pupil engagement with the apps. Results showed {SEND} pupils could interact with the apps and all pupils passed at least one topic. Average progress rate for {SEND} pupils was twice as long as mainstream peers. Stepwise regression revealed extent of disability significantly predicted progress rate. Further exploratory correlations revealed pupils with moderate to severe difficulties with hearing and/or language made slower progress through the apps than those with greater functionality in these two domains because the use of verbal instructions within the apps limited their capacity to learn. This original quantitative analysis demonstrates that interactive apps can raise learning standards in pupils with {SEND} but may have limited utility for pupils with severe difficulties. Software modifications are needed to address specific areas of difficulty preventing pupils from progressing.},

We argue that much of the related research has focused only on a few dimensions, paying little or no attention to others and, most importantly, to potential relationships between them. Our belief is that the improvement of the effectiveness of mobile interventions to support mental health necessarily implies that developers and therapists comprehensively consider the interaction between the proposed dimensions. Taking as a starting point the three areas of knowledge (Technology, Context, and Mental Health), we re-examine each area to identify relevant dimensions, discuss the relationships between them and finally draw a series of considerations. The resulting considerations can help therapists and developers to devise, design, and generate custom mobile applications in a way that increases the motivation and engagement of patients and, therefore, the effectiveness of psychological treatments.},

Furthermore, we exploit variation in reservation and transaction prices to study potential screening and sunk cost effects. Our main results show that, consistent with the over-exclusion perspective documented for essential health products, the willingness to pay for glasses is low, amounting to 20\% of the current market price. Information provided through a video raises the willingness to pay for corrective glasses by 16\%. In contrast, deferred payment does not affect the willingness to pay. Finally, we find no evidence of screening or sunk cost effects. Overall our results lend support to subsidization of eyeglasses in a resource poor setting.},

Almost no research examines the impact of poor vision on school performance, and simple {OLS} estimates could be biased because studying harder may adversely affects one's vision. This paper presents results from a randomized trial in Western China that offered free eyeglasses to rural primary school students. Our preferred estimates, which exclude township pairs for which students in the control township were mistakenly provided eyeglasses, indicate that wearing eyeglasses for one academic year increased the average test scores of students with poor vision by 0.16 to 0.22 standard deviations, equivalent to 0.3 to 0.5 additional years of schooling. These estimates are averages across the two counties where the intervention was conducted. We also find that the benefits are greater for under-performing students. A simple cost-benefit analysis suggests very high economic returns to wearing eyeglasses, raising the question of why such investments are not made by most families. We find that girls are more likely to refuse free eyeglasses, and that parental lack of awareness of vision problems, mothers' education, and economic factors (expenditures per capita and price) significantly affect whether children wear eyeglasses in the absence of the intervention.},

Much of the association appears to reflect lower educational attainment among adults with disabilities. People of ages 6–17 with disabilities do not live in systematically wealthier or poorer households than other people of their age, although in all countries studied they are significantly less likely to start school or to be enrolled at the time of the survey. The order of magnitude of the school participation deficit associated with disability—which is as high as 50 percentage points in 3 of the 13 countries—is often larger than deficits related to other characteristics, such as gender, rural residence, or economic status differentials.

	abstract = {Purpose
We report the findings from a pilot study in western Kenya, using an experimental design to test whether comprehensive support used to keep adolescent orphans in school can reduce risk factors associated with infection with human immunodeficiency virus.
Methods
Adolescent orphans aged 12–14 years (N = 105) in Nyanza Province were randomized to condition, after stratifying by household, gender, and baseline survey report of sexual behavior. The intervention comprised school fees, uniforms, and a “community visitor” who monitored school attendance and helped to resolve problems that would lead to absence or dropout. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations over two time points, controlling for gender and age.
Results
Compared with the control group, intervention students were less likely to drop out of school, commence sexual intercourse, or report attitudes supporting early sex. School support also increased prosocial bonding and gender equity attitudes.
Conclusions
After 1 year of exposure to the intervention, we found evidence suggesting that comprehensive school support can prevent school dropout, delay sexual debut, and reduce risk factors associated with infection with human immunodeficiency virus. Further research, with much larger samples, is needed to better understand factors that mediate the association between educational support and delayed sexual debut, and how gender might moderate these relationships.},

	abstract = {The evolution of mobile phone technology has introduced new possibilities to the field of medicine. Combining technological advances with medical expertise has led to the use of mobile phones in all healthcare areas including diagnostics, telemedicine, research, reference libraries and interventions. This article provides an overview of the peer -reviewed literature, published between 1 August 2006 and 1 August 2011, for the application of mobile/cell phones (from basic text-messaging systems to smartphones) in healthcare in both resource-poor and high-income countries. Smartphone use is paving the way in high-income countries, while basic text-messaging systems of standard mobile phones are proving to be of value in low- and middle-income countries. Ranging from infection outbreak reporting, anti-{HIV} therapy adherence to gait analysis, resuscitation training and radiological imaging, the current uses and future possibilities of mobile phone technology in healthcare are endless. Multiple mobile phone based applications are available for healthcare workers and healthcare consumers; however, the absolute majority lack an evidence base. Therefore, more rigorous research is required to ensure that healthcare is not flooded with non-evidence based applications and is maximized for patient benefit.},

	abstract = {Introduction Disability and poverty are believed to operate in a cycle, with each reinforcing the other. While agreement on the existence of a link is strong, robust empirical evidence substantiating and describing this potential association is lacking. Consequently, a systematic review was undertaken to explore the relationship between disability and economic poverty, with a focus on the situation in low and middle income countries ({LMICs}). Methods Ten electronic databases were searched to retrieve studies of any epidemiological design, published between 1990-March 2016 with data comparing the level of poverty between people with and without disabilities in {LMICs} (World Bank classifications). Poverty was defined using economic measures (e.g. assets, income), while disability included both broad assessments (e.g. self-reported functional or activity limitations) and specific impairments/disorders. Data extracted included: measures of association between disability and poverty, population characteristics and study characteristics. Proportions of studies finding positive, negative, null or mixed associations between poverty and disability were then disaggregated by population and study characteristics. Results From the 15,500 records retrieved and screened, 150 studies were included in the final sample. Almost half of included studies were conducted in China, India or Brazil (n = 70, 47\%). Most studies were cross-sectional in design (n = 124, 83\%), focussed on specific impairment types (n = 115, 77\%) and used income as the measure for economic poverty (n = 82, 55\%). 122 studies (81\%) found evidence of a positive association between disability and a poverty marker. This relationship persisted when results were disaggregated by gender, measure of poverty used and impairment types. By country income group at the time of data collection, the proportion of country-level analyses with a positive association increased with the rising income level, with 59\% of low-income, 67\% of lower-middle and 72\% of upper-middle income countries finding a positive relationship. By age group, the proportion of studies reporting a positive association between disability and poverty was lowest for older adults and highest for working-age adults (69\% vs. 86\%). Conclusions There is strong evidence for a link between disability and poverty in {LMICs} and an urgent need for further research and programmatic/policy action to break the cycle.},

	abstract = {The {COVID}-19 pandemic has closed schools for over 1.6 billion children, with potentially long-term consequences. This paper provides some of the first experimental evidence on strategies to minimize the fallout of the pandemic on education outcomes. We evaluate two low-technology interventions to substitute schooling during this period: {SMS} text messages and direct phone calls. We conduct a rapid trial in Botswana to inform real-time policy responses collecting data at four- to six-week intervals. We present results from the first wave. We find early evidence that both interventions result in cost-effective learning gains of 0.16 to 0.29 standard deviations. This translates to a reduction in innumeracy of up to 52 percent. We show these results broadly hold with a series of robustness tests that account for differential attrition. We find increased parental engagement in their child’s education and more accurate parent perceptions of their child’s learning. In a second wave of the trial, we provide targeted instruction, customizing text messages to the child's learning level using data from the first wave. The low-tech interventions tested have immediate policy relevance and could have long-run implications for the role of technology and parents as substitutes or complements to the traditional education system.},

The evaluation design consists of a randomized experiment for families around the first quintile of the poverty index and of a regression discontinuity design for families around the second quintile of this index, which is the program's eligibility threshold. This allows us to compare results from two different credible identification methods, and to investigate whether the impact varies with families' poverty level. Around the first quintile of the poverty index the impact is positive while it is equal to zero around the second quintile. This suggests that for the poorest families the program lifts a credit constraint while this is not the case for families close to the eligibility threshold.},

Policy simulations based on a set of ‘plausible’ interventions show that in rural Mozambique, building more schools or raising adult literacy will have a larger impact on primary school enrolment rates than interventions that raise household income. When relative costs are considered, adult literacy campaigns are nearly 10 times more cost-effective than the income intervention and 1.5 to 2.5 times better than building more schools.},

	abstract = {The effects of {EU} candidacy and accession on disability rights in education and employment are examined in two new member and two candidate countries. The development of {EU} disability policy is also discussed, especially as {EU} policy impacts reforms in Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Analysis is based on the existing literature and personal communication with scholars and activists in the countries of inquiry. Although considerable progress has been made in antidiscrimination legislation in the four countries, a lack of political will and inadequate financing means that real on-the-ground progress in advancing disability rights is limited. The article concludes with recommendations for how the {EU} and its administrative bodies and members of disability communities in the four countries can better advance disability rights in education and employment as part of the accession process.},

The objective of this study is threefold: firstly, to reveal the design principles to be followed in developing an interactive and affordable computer-enabled table-top tool for the children with special needs; secondly, to develop a physical prototype following the revealed principles; and finally, to evaluate the usability performance of this tool. This study presents a mixed method research while the data collection process includes both ethnographic study and semi-structured interviews of both the teachers and students of a special school dedicated for teaching the children with {ASD}. As outcomes, along with a list of design principles, and a prototype of a computer-enabled, single touch, single user, and affordable educational intervention tool targeting the children diagnosed with {ASD}, the results of the empirical evaluation of the prototype demonstrated high effectiveness (72\% average success rate for the students vs. 92\% for the teachers), efficiency (1.20 minutes average task completion time for the students vs. 0.48 minutes for the teachers) and satisfaction rate (4.46 for the students vs. 4.66 for the teachers out of 5) for the developed tool. Both types of the participants were found satisfied with the usability of the tabletop prototype and positively endorsed its effectiveness in improving the learning environment of the children with special needs.},

Data reported here focuses on the disability status of children aged 5 to 16 years, their access to school and learning outcomes on basic reading and maths tasks. Our findings highlight that children who were identified by their carer/mothers as having moderate to severe disabilities were less likely to be attending school and had lower levels of learning on basic reading and maths tasks, than their peers who were not identified as having any difficulties in functioning. More importantly, our findings also suggest that being a co-resident/sibling in a household with a child with moderate to severe disabilities was associated with lower levels of basic reading and numeracy for the co-residents/siblings compared to other children. We conclude by highlighting important policy considerations and identifying areas of future research.},

However, students without disabilities experience slightly lower achievement when taught by a special-education certified teacher. In-service professional development has no effect on the value-added of teachers in special education courses, but non-disabled students whose regular education teachers received special education training exhibit modestly higher achievement. Similarly, the gain in effectiveness associated with teacher experience is greater for teachers of regular education courses than for teachers of special education courses. Teachers with advanced degrees are more effective in boosting the math achievement of students with disabilities than are those with only a baccalaureate degree.},

	abstract = {About 10\% of primary school students in developing countries have poor vision, but very few of them wear glasses. Almost no research examines the impact of poor vision on school performance, and simple {OLS} estimates could be biased because studying harder may adversely affects one's vision. This paper presents results from a randomized trial in Western China that offered free eyeglasses to rural primary school students. Our preferred estimates, which exclude township pairs for which students in the control township were mistakenly provided eyeglasses, indicate that wearing eyeglasses for one academic year increased the average test scores of students with poor vision by 0.16 to 0.22 standard deviations, equivalent to 0.3 to 0.5 additional years of schooling. These estimates are averages across the two counties where the intervention was conducted. We also find that the benefits are greater for under-performing students. A simple cost-benefit analysis suggests very high economic returns to wearing eyeglasses, raising the question of why such investments are not made by most families. We find that girls are more likely to refuse free eyeglasses, and that parental lack of awareness of vision problems, mothers' education, and economic factors (expenditures per capita and price) significantly affect whether children wear eyeglasses in the absence of the intervention.},

This policy is peculiar because it also changes the sheepskin effects (signaling effects) of schooling, through its redefinition of the schooling tiers. The policy is also interesting due to its large spillover effects on post-compulsory schooling as well as its remarkable overall effect; for instance, we find that the completed years of schooling by age 17 increases by 1.5 years for rural women. The policy equalizes the educational attainment of urban and rural children substantially. The urban-rural gap in the completed years of schooling at age 17 falls by 0.5 years for men and by 0.7 to 0.8 years for women. However, there is no evidence of a narrowing gender gap with the policy. On the contrary, the gender gap in urban areas in post-compulsory schooling widens.},

The purpose of this study was to understand the experiences of exclusion and bullying among children with disabilities. Method: We draw on qualitative in-depth interviews and a focus group with children and youth with disabilities (n = 15) to explore their experiences of exclusion and bullying. Results: Our results showed that restrictions in the socio-contextual environment influenced the social exclusion that children experienced. Youth encountered social exclusion from both teachers and peers. Children reported that teachers’ attitudes toward children with disabilities often influenced the social exclusion experienced by peers. Bullies engaged in both implicit and explicit forms of social exclusion toward children with disabilities which often lead to verbal and physical bullying. Conclusions: Children with cerebral palsy are victims of bullying and social exclusion within the school context. More opportunities for social inclusion are needed.Implications for {RehabilitationChildren} and youth with cerebral palsy experience verbal and physical bullying at school.Rehabilitation health care providers and educators should be cognizant of the symptoms of childhood bullying and be prepared to provide children and their parents with resources on how to cope.Health care providers and educators should teach children how to explain their disability and their specific needs to their teachers and peers to create more awareness and understanding about their condition.},

	abstract = {Background: In South Africa, disability limits access to education and leads to economic and social exclusion. Identifying related barriers is a first step in solving this problem. This study explores barriers to education among disabled youths in South Africa. Methods: Fieldworkers identified households with disabled youths aged 18 to 35 years. A snowball sample consisting of 989 individuals was used in the study. These individuals were interviewed at nine sites in five South African provinces. The sample consisted of 523 (52.9\%) disabled and 466 (47.1\%) non-disabled youths. Physical disability (n=231, 44.2\%) comprised the largest group in the sample, followed by intellectual disability (n=169, 32.3\%) the second largest. Differences in education between disabled and non-disabled youth groups were established via χ 2 -tests. Logistic regression analyses were also used to find educational barriers for disabled youth. Results: As expected, we found a large difference between non-disabled and disabled youths who currently attend or attended school in the past (99.3\% vs. 82.4\%; p≤0.001). Results from the logistic regression analyses among the disabled youth showed no significant relationship between financial exclusion and education. Social exclusion and exclusion by design were significantly associated with education. Conclusions: The study’s findings suggest that special attention should be given to vulnerable groups who are disproportionally disadvantaged and to the specific education barriers they face, which may require a combination of various interventions. Reducing negative social attitudes requires interventions aimed at teachers and families of disabled youth. Exclusion by design can be reduced through proper information about schools, less difficult admission systems, improved access, and elimination of physical obstacles.},

The opportunity for education constitutes not just a means of achieving learning outcomes but also a space for social interaction, individual development and psychosocial support, which are paramount in Conflict-Affected Fragile States ({CAFS}). However, many persisting barriers still need to be overcome in Afghanistan to allow education for all and change negative attitudes towards education of children with disabilities. In this paper we argue that viewing education as a basic commodity, which is the widespread practice in {CAFS}, is not conducive to expanding human freedoms and capabilities. More specifically, through analyses of a national survey, we demonstrate that despite considerable resources, increasing access to education in Afghanistan has maintained processes of marginalisation of the already excluded.},

	abstract = {In this article, barriers faced by Nepalese with disabilities in obtaining a school education are discussed. The study employed both quantitative and qualitative method to analyse the barrier using unique data collected from survey and in-depth interviews. It was found that some barriers were impairment-specific, while some were faced commonly irrespective of the type of impairments. People with visual and hearing impairments faced the inadequacy of support systems in schools, whereas participants with physical impairments mainly faced difficulties caused by physical barriers, such as inaccessible buildings and the lack of safe, accessible roads. Additionally, the barriers faced in common by the participants were financial barriers, resulting from parents' poverty; and barriers resulting from parental attitude, social stigma and lack of awareness. Participants with hearing impairments were found to be more vulnerable to the barriers to education, and as a result they had fewer years of schooling than their counterparts with visual and physical impairments. Results suggest that awareness of disability issues at all levels is the first step toward implementing strategies and policies to combat other problems like poverty and the lack of resources. Only with a more comprehensive understanding can effective policies to eliminate these barriers be developed.},

	abstract = {Out of school children are a critical issue in education and development. Very little is known as to whether a disability is associated with a higher risk of being out of school for children in developing countries. This paper presents and analyzes the gap in enrolment in both primary and secondary education between children with and without disabilities using for the first time an internationally tested and comparable measure of functional difficulties (e.g. seeing, hearing, and walking). Using nationally representative datasets from 15 developing countries, this paper finds a consistent and statistically significant disability gap in both primary and secondary school attendance. The paper econometrically examines potential explanations for this disability gap using several specifications. A household fixed effect model shows that disability reduces the probability of school attendance by a median 30.9 percentage points, and that neither individual characteristics nor their socio-economic and unobserved household characteristics explain the disability gap. While general poverty reduction policies through for instance social transfers to the poor may improve school attendance in general, they seem unlikely to close the disability gap in schooling. The disability gap for primary–age children follows an inverted U-shape relationship with {GNI} per capita. This suggests that, as {GNI} per capita rises and more resources become available for improving access to education in middle-income countries, children without disabilities increasingly attend school, whereas the situation of children with disabilities may improve more slowly. Despite the adoption of an inclusive education agenda globally, this paper shows that more research and policy attention is needed to make schooling disability-inclusive in developing countries. More attention is also necessary regarding the functional difficulties experienced by children, as some may be preventable and the schooling inequalities associated with them may thus be avoidable.},

Using data from a large representative household survey, we employ a triple difference approach (using boys and the neighboring state of Jharkhand as comparison groups) and find that being in a cohort that was exposed to the Cycle program increased girls' age-appropriate enrollment in secondary school by 32 percent and reduced the corresponding gender gap by 40 percent. We also find an 18 percent increase in the number of girls who appear for the high-stakes secondary school certificate exam, and a 12 percent increase in the number of girls who pass it. Parametric and non-parametric decompositions of the triple-difference estimate as a function of distance to the nearest secondary school show that the increases in enrollment mostly took place in villages that were further away from a secondary school, suggesting that the mechanism of impact was the reduction in the time and safety cost of school attendance made possible by the bicycle. We also find that the Cycle program was much more cost effective at increasing girls' secondary school enrollment than comparable conditional cash transfer programs in South Asia.
